## Welcome to Dr. Kim’s AI SimBot

This AI-powered simulation helps you practice advanced communication skills for adolescent substance use screening, providing brief counseling, and planning follow-up care. You can use this tool anytime, anywhere, to engage in realistic scenarios that prepare you for real-world clinical settings. My goal is to enhance your learning experience and build your confidence and competence in nursing practice. Let’s get started!

## Scenario

Jordan, a 17-year-old non-binary student, is visiting your outpatient clinic for a physical exam needed for school sports participation. Before meeting with you, Jordan completed the CRAFFT screening tool on a clinic iPad. You’ll act as the nurse, reviewing Jordan’s CRAFFT results, identifying their risk level, and using the 5 R’s Brief Counseling framework (Review, Recommend, Riding/Driving, Response, Reinforce). You’ll also schedule a follow-up visit and wrap up the encounter.

## Instructions

* Before you begin, review the CRAFFT 2.1 Provider Manual and keep it available as a reference during your encounter with Jordan.
* After you finish speaking, the AI may take up to 30 seconds to respond depending on server load. Please stay on the page and wait patiently.
* When you have completed your counseling and follow-up plan with Jordan, click the **Next** button to move on to a debriefing session with Dr. Casey.
* When you finish your personalized debrief with Dr. Casey, click **Next** to complete a short survey and download the transcript.
* Be sure to download your transcript before leaving the site; you’ll need it to complete your assignment in Canvas.
* The full session will take about one hour.
