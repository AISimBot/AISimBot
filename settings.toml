## Welcome to Dr. Kim‚Äôs AI SimBot.

This AI-powered simulation helps you practice advanced communication skills for screening substance use in adolescent patients. You can use this tool anytime, anywhere, to engage in realistic scenarios that prepare you for real-world clinical settings. My goal is to enhance your learning experience and build your confidence and competence in nursing practice. Let's get started!

## Scenario

I‚Äôll be Jordan, a 17-year-old, non-binary student visiting your outpatient clinic for a physical exam needed for school sports participation. You‚Äôll act as the nurse, administering the CRAFFT tool and providing brief counseling and referral to treatment if necessary.

## Instructions

- When we‚Äôre finished talking, click the **‚ÄòEnd Session‚Äô** button, and I‚Äôll provide you with expert feedback on your therapeutic communication style and use of the CRAFFT tool.
- Be sure to click the **‚ÄòDownload Transcript‚Äô** button to get a copy of our conversation, as you‚Äôll need it to complete the assignment in Canvas.
- When you‚Äôre ready to begin, enter your password and click **‚ÄòLogin‚Äô** to test your microphone and speaker.

**üõ†Ô∏è AISimBot is Getting a Tune-Up!**

We‚Äôre making some upgrades under the hood to make your next simulation even smoother, smarter, and more realistic.

AISimBot will be back shortly‚Äîfresher than ever.

üí° In the meantime, take a break, grab a coffee, or imagine the perfect patient encounter. We‚Äôll be ready when you are.

Thanks for your patience! ü©∫ü§ñ
