## Welcome to Dr. Kimâ€™s AI SimBot.

This AI-powered simulation helps you practice advanced communication skills for screening substance use in adolescent patients. You can use this tool anytime, anywhere, to engage in realistic scenarios that prepare you for real-world clinical settings. My goal is to enhance your learning experience and build your confidence and competence in nursing practice. Let's get started!

## Scenario

Iâ€™ll be Jordan, a 17-year-old, non-binary student visiting your outpatient clinic for a physical exam needed for school sports participation. Youâ€™ll act as the nurse, administering the CRAFFT tool and providing brief counseling and referral to treatment if necessary.

## Instructions

- When weâ€™re finished talking, click the **â€˜End Sessionâ€™** button, and Iâ€™ll provide you with expert feedback on your therapeutic communication style and use of the CRAFFT tool.
- Be sure to click the **â€˜Download Transcriptâ€™** button to get a copy of our conversation, as youâ€™ll need it to complete the assignment in Canvas.
- When youâ€™re ready to begin, enter your password and click **â€˜Start Chatâ€™**.
