## Welcome to Dr. Kim’s AI SimBot.

This AI-powered simulation helps you practice advanced communication skills for screening substance use in adolescent patients. You can use this tool anytime, anywhere, to engage in realistic scenarios that prepare you for real-world clinical settings. My goal is to enhance your learning experience and build your confidence and competence in nursing practice. Let's get started!

## Scenario

Jordan, a 17-year-old, non-binary student is visiting your outpatient clinic for a physical exam needed for school sports participation. You’ll act as the nurse, administering the CRAFFT tool and providing brief counseling and referral to treatment if necessary.

## Instructions

* Before getting started, make sure you have the CRAFFT tool available. You’ll need to reference this during the session. 
* When you're finished talking to Jordan, click the ’Next’ button.
* Dr. Casey, a virtual debriefer, will begin a personalized debriefing session with you. When you’re finished, click the ’Next’ button. 
* Be sure to click the ‘Download Transcript’ button to get a copy of conversation with Jordan and Dr. Casey, as you’ll need it to complete the assignment in Canvas!
* Now that you know what to expect, enter the password and click ‘Login’ to test your microphone and speaker and begin.
